  Weightlifting in its purest form is lifting something up and putting it back down. That’s the deadlift in a nutshell.
  It’s simplicity personified and one of the best muscle-growing, strength-building, health-improving moves around.
If you know how to deadlift safely, the move will strengthen every bone in your body,
 challenge every muscle across your posterior chain (all the muscles that run from your neck to your heels) and test your grip strength and core stability to the absolute max.
 It will find any chink in your armour that you need to address if you hope to lift heavy.
For that reason you should always start light, within your means, and build up the weight once your deadlift form is flawless.
It’s a great addition to the routine of anyone who’s guilty of just training their
 “mirror muscles” on the front of the body – think chest, abs and quads – at the expense of those on the rear of the body,
 especially the lower back and hamstrings. Doing so will result in an unbalanced physique, and significant strength discrepancies between synergistic muscle groups that can lead to injury.
