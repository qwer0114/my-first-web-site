<p>An individual's physical strength is determined by two factors: the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers recruited to generate force and the intensity of the recruitment.
Individuals with a high proportion of type I slow twitch muscle fibers will be relatively weaker than a similar individual with a high proportion of type II fast twitch fibers,
but would have greater endurance. The genetic inheritance of muscle fiber type sets the outermost boundaries of physical strength possible (barring the use of enhancing agents such as testosterone),
although the unique position within this envelope is determined by training.
Individual muscle fiber ratios can be determined through a muscle biopsy.
Other considerations are the ability to recruit muscle fibers for a particular activity, joint angles, and the length of each limb.
For a given cross-section, shorter limbs are able to lift more weight.
The ability to gain muscle also varies person to person, based mainly upon genes dictating the amounts of hormones secreted,
but also on sex, age, health of the person, and adequate nutrients in the diet. A one-repetition maximum test is the most accurate way to determine maximum muscular strength.
